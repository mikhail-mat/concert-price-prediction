# concert-price-prediction
This is my first own project in Machine Learning, and it's a regression model using data from this repo: https://github.com/AinaFih/Concerts_Dataset-Project. It contains simulated concert data such as artists, genres, performances, and pricing. My model predicts ticket prices given input features mentioned above.

The model doesn't perform really well, as the dataset is very small (30 examples), the data doesn't seem to follow a linear or polynomial relationship, and most features contain a large number of unique categorical values.

This project is a learning lesson for me about the importance of good data with genuine relationships to learn from. I have also acquired a lot of knowledge about extracting data from a sql file, processing, encoding, and visualising it.
